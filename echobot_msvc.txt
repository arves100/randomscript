Requirements:
	Microsoft Visual Studio 2019
	CMake

1. git clone https://github.com/DiscordPP/echo-bot
Note: remember to git submodule update --init --recursive

2. Download and install OpenSSL from here: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
Note: The light version does not contain the developer files in order to use it

3. Download and install boost from here: https://www.boost.org/users/download/
and extract it.

4. Open a Visual Studio command prompt (Start -> search visual studio command prompt -> open it)

5. Go to boost folder with the cmd (cd <folder>)

6. Compile Boost beast (or at least what's required for it)
If it's your first time compiling boost, first type bootstrap for build Boost.Build.

Then type b2 --with-coroutine --with-filesystem --with-system --with-date_time --with-chrono link=shared

Note: if you are compiling in 64bit add "address-model=64" in the b2 command
Note 2: At this time discord++ does not support linking against boost static libraries.

7. With cmake, set BOOST_ROOT with the directory of Boost (cmake BOOST_ROOT=<dir>) or with cmake-gui

8. Open the target folder and build the solution as usual.

You can now use echo_bot. 

Make sure to copy the shared dlls from Boost stage folder to echo_bot exe folder

Make also sure to copy OpenSSL Win32 DLLs from your OpenSSL installation directory to echo_bot exe folder
(NOTE: Required only if you don't install OpenSSL DLLs inside Windows binary folder)
